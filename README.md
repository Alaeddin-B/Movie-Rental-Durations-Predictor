# DVD Rental Duration Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the number of days customers will rent DVDs based on movie features and rental characteristics.

## 🎯 Project Objective

A DVD rental company seeks to optimize their inventory planning by predicting rental durations. The goal is to develop a regression model that achieves a **Mean Squared Error (MSE) < 3.0** on the test set.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains rental information with the following key features:
- **Temporal Features**: `rental_date`, `return_date`
- **Financial Features**: `amount`, `rental_rate`, `replacement_cost`
- **Movie Features**: `release_year`, `length`, `special_features`
- **Rating Categories**: `NC-17`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `R` (dummy variables)
- **Engineered Features**: Squared terms for numerical features

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Created target variable: `rental_length_days` (rental duration in days)
- Generated dummy variables for special features (Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes, Commentaries, Trailers)
- Feature selection: Removed temporal and categorical source columns

### 2. Model Development Pipeline
```
Data Exploration → Preprocessing → Baseline Models → Hyperparameter Tuning → Ensemble Methods → Final Evaluation
```

### 3. Models Evaluated

#### Baseline Models (Cross-Validation)
| Model | RMSE | MSE | Status |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| **Random Forest** | **1.4223** | **2.0229** | ✅ **Best Baseline** |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 1.6392 | 2.6869 | ✅ Meets Target |
| Linear Regression | 1.7150 | 2.9412 | ✅ Meets Target |
| Ridge Regression | 1.7150 | 2.9412 | ✅ Meets Target |
| Lasso Regression | 1.9508 | 3.8056 | ❌ Above Target |
| SVR | 2.6723 | 7.1412 | ❌ Above Target |

#### Optimized Models (Test Set Performance)
| Model | RMSE | MSE | Improvement |
|-------|------|-----|-------------|
| **Gradient Boosting (Tuned)** | **1.3729** | **1.8850** | **🏆 Best Model** |
| Voting Regressor (Optimized) | 1.3772 | 1.8967 | +2.8% vs baseline |
| Voting Regressor (Simple) | 1.3828 | 1.9121 | +2.6% vs baseline |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | 1.4056 | 1.9757 | +1.2% vs baseline |
