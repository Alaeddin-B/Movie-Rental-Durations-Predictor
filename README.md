## 🎯 Business Objective

A DVD rental company requires predictive modeling assistance to optimize their inventory planning. They need a machine learning solution to predict rental durations with high accuracy.

**Target Goal**: Develop a regression model that achieves **RMSE < Standard Deviation** of the target variable, ensuring the model performs better than a naive mean predictor and provides statistically meaningful predictions.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (`rental_info.csv`) contains comprehensive rental information with the following features:

### 📅 Date/Time Features

- **`rental_date`**: The date and time when the customer rents the DVD
- **`return_date`**: The date and time when the customer returns the DVD

### 💰 Financial Features

- **`amount`**: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD
- **`amount_2`**: The square of the amount (feature engineering)
- **`rental_rate`**: The rate at which the DVD is rented
- **`rental_rate_2`**: The square of the rental rate
- **`replacement_cost`**: The cost to replace the DVD

### 🎬 Movie Features

- **`release_year`**: The year the movie was released
- **`length`**: Length of the movie in minutes  
- **`length_2`**: The square of the movie length
- **`special_features`**: Special features included (trailers, deleted scenes, etc.)

### 🏷️ Rating Features (Dummy Variables)

- **`NC-17`**, **`PG`**, **`PG-13`**, **`R`**: Binary indicators for movie ratings

### 🔧 Engineered Features

- **Special feature indicators**: Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes, Commentaries, Trailers
- **`n_features`**: Total count of special features
- **`is_weekend`**: Weekend rental indicator
- **`movie_age`**: Age of the movie at rental time

## 🔬 Methodology & Technical Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Target Variable Creation**: `rental_length_days` (calculated from rental and return dates)
- **Feature Engineering**: Created dummy variables for special features categories
- **Derived Features**: Weekend indicators, movie age, feature counts
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers
- **Feature Selection**: Removed temporal and categorical source columns

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
